    "For simulation and reconstruction we need Xmax position, antenna model, RFchain, galactic model and also\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1) Model of polarization angle \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining the polarization angle as an adjustment parameter of the reconstruction seems to be a big challenge. I tried to do it this fall without success. Currently I changed strategy, the reconstruction is done considering that the electric field is produced by a air shower where the polarization angle is constrained. The polarization angle is estimated with the simulations with 5 parameters: distance, direction of xmax in the DU frame, direction of DU in the shower frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2) Model of power spectrum density of E field\n",
    "\n",
    "Wiener deconvolution needs an estimation of power spectrum density of E field. \n",
    "From my observations the spectrum is almost affine with the log scale in the GRAND frequency band. When the electric field is strong the spectrum tends to be flat and steep when it is weak. 2 points of the spectrum are therefore sufficient. The model consists of sampling the value of these 2 points for the maximum voltage value and the xmax position on all triggered traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3) Polarization trigger with model of voltage \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given direction and polarization angle, the antenna transfer function will be the same. Given that the shower spectrum has a \"log-affine\" shape, if we assume that the slope change is small, then the spectra are proportional.  Another way to justify this is to point out that the electric field pulses all have the same shape up to a scale factor, the difference is the duration of the pulse. Since our detector is a linear time-invariant system, the voltage will also be proportional.\n",
    "This should be verified in voltage simulations. If this is not the case, it is possible to create spectrum level intervals where the proportionality assumption is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to define a proportionality constraint on the voltages measured for a air shower for a given direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4) Polarization trigger with reconstruction of E field\n",
    "\n",
    "For this test you must have at least 2 antennas that are not blind, ie $L^i_{eff}{=}\\llap{/\\,}0$ in the direction of xmax. If the polar angle $\\alpha_{pol}$ estimated is really the good one, the estimation of $\\hat{e}_{pol}$ must close, including the maximum value. So this function:\n",
